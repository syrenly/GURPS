## What is GURPS

GURPS is an acronym for "Generic Universal RolePlaying System", and it is a tabletop role-playing game system designed to allow for play in any game setting (fantasy, sci-fi, superheroes, historical, etc...). Every player starts with N points, decided by the game master, and spends them to buy traits and skills to become more powerful (did you learn martial arts from a great master? Did you get a master degree in chemistry?) or can earn additional points buying negative traits (do you have any addiction? Did you lose an arm in battle? Have you got a bad temper?). The purpose of the creation of the character is indeed to add spices and uniqueness to the story, with the limits given by the selected setting (e.g. a historical campaign should not allow magic). The player rolls 3 six-sided die when must do something that involves a specific skill: it means that the rolls follow the Gaussian curve and that results as 10 and 11 are more likely to appear then a 3 (critical failure) or a 18 (critical success). This kind of mechanism let the game to be less random and more focused in how the players characterized their characters.

## What is The Silence of Hollowind

The Silence of Hollowind is an Urban Fantasy role playing setting, which can be adapted to several different rules systems.
Hollowind is a vast megalopolis that fifty years ago, thanks to Merlin‚Äôs Edict, managed to overthrow the tyranny of arcane families; since that very moment it has been fighting the remaining survivors of the Purge. The Bureaus represent the first line of defense in their daily battle against enemies within and without, observing the motto: order, reveal, and persecute. Anyone attempting to break this new balance, conquered with the blood of thousands, will have to face the Bureaus. The arcanists are always plotting, and people must remain vigilant.
