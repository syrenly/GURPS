## Glifist Censor

Glifists are not magic characters. They can cast spells drawing symbols using specific equipment charged with manalite. Each charge equals 12 Fatigue Points. Glifists recharge their equipment at his department, justifing the use of each charge (like bullets for Detectives or Persecutors). They studied a large variety of spells, but they specialized on fews.

**Well-known spells**: Glifists can specialize on a limited number of spells. They can buy a well-known spell at 8 points. In standard conditions, these spells can be cast using Ritual Magic, without malus, with standard duration, casting time and use of Fatigue Points (from the charge of manalite) and can be maintained.

**Known spells**: Glifists studied many spells at Academy, but they cannot remember all of them at once. They can ask from their department a Grimoire. This count as additional equipment. The Grimoire contains all the spells Glifists are authorized to cast. To cast a spell, Glifists have two options:

- The Master secretly rolls against the Glifist’s IQ to check how well he remembers the spell, then the Glifist rolls on Ritual Magic to cast it. Very good IQ rolls or critical successes mean that the spell is casted as a well-known one. A good or average roll gives a minor malus. For bad rolls, see the table of failures.
- Glifists can cast spells as well-known ones, but it takes more time. Each fatigue point needed to normally cast the spell is equal to five minutes of casting time (more fatigue points = more difficult spell). During the day, he could cast the same spell many times using this option. In this case, he will cast the spell at half the time of the previous one (but the time cannot be less of a well-known one. If he uses the spell very often, the master can consider the spell as a well-known one without spending points).
